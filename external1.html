        <h2>What is ERP FI/CO?</h2>
        <p>
          The **Financial Accounting (FI)** module in ERP is designed for
          managing all external accounting processes, including general ledger,
          accounts payable, accounts receivable, and asset accounting. It
          ensures that all financial transactions are recorded accurately and
          comply with legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The **Controlling (CO)** module focuses on internal accounting,
          providing tools for planning, budgeting, and monitoring costs. It
          helps in decision-making by analyzing profitability and cost
          efficiency.
