        <h2 id="procurement-process">The Procurement Process</h2>
        <p>
          The procurement process in MM covers the entire cycle from identifying
          a need for materials or services to receiving and paying for them.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Creating a Purchase Requisition (T-code: ME51N)</h3>
        <p>
          A Purchase Requisition (PR) is an internal document requesting the
          procurement department to procure a certain quantity of a material or
          service by a certain date.
        </p>
        <ol>

        <h3>4. Invoice Verification (T-code: MIRO)</h3>
        <p>
          Invoice Verification is the final step in the procurement process,
          where vendor invoices are checked against purchase orders and goods
          receipts.
